# SAMPLES Directory

This directory contains sample audio files used for testing and reference purposes.

**Important:** These files are for reference only and should not be modified. They demonstrate the types of audio files the tool is designed to process.

The tool uses these samples to verify functionality, but they are not part of the actual tool distribution. Audio files in this directory are ignored by Git (see `.gitignore`).
